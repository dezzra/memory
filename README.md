Uses the "simplegui" module.

Branch "cleanup":

- fix the code to use math to properly position the cards, rather than using ranges of [i] 1-4, 5-8, etc.

- add an interface to choose the number of cards?  As long as it's always in two rows, it would work well.  

- add an option to choose how many cards have to match?  If 3 cards, then make it three rows to simplify code.
